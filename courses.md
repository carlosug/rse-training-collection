# Coderefinery workshop

## Goal:
> teach basic scientific computing tools and become familiar with tools and best practices for scientific software develpment

## Requirements:
Some programming experience, but generic-proposed approach

## Level:
Essentials (foundational skills)

## Duration:
6 half-days

## Overview content and lessons:

1. Intro to version control with Git I, II, III, and IV
    - creating repository
    - adding files and commiting changes
    - git history and log
    - writing useful commit messages
    - ignoring files and paths
    - creating and working branches
    - merging and deleting branches
    - conflict resolutions 
    - publishing an existing repository
    - cloning a repository
2. Collaborative distributed version I and II
    - Centralized workflow
    - creating pull request
    - code review and merging changes
    - version control
    - fork and clone
    - pen pull request
3. Reproducible research:
    - preparing code to be usable by you and others in the future 
    - organizing projects with readme.md
    - directory structure
    - tracking source code, data, and results
    - reproducible publication e.g. binder, rrtools, jupyter notebooks (not practical)
    - recording computational steps e.g. snakemake *(Make GNu is not included)*
    - recording dependencies e.g. python venv and requirements.txt or environment.yml
    - recording environment e.g. container Singularity *(Docker, podman is not included in practice)*
4. Social coding and open software:
    - Social coding: sharing software, code reusability
    - software licensing
    - software citation e.g. citation.cff
    - sharing data: general institutional repositories *(what about models)*
5. How to document your research software:
    - in-code documentation
    - readme files
    - reStructuredText and Markdown
    - HTML static site generators
    - Wikis
    - deploying Sphinx documentation to Github pages
    - Hosting websites/homepages on Github
6. Jupyter notebooks
    - a tool to write and share executable notebooks and data visualization
7. Automated testing
    - preventing yourself and others from breaking your functioning code 
    - testing type
    - test design e.g. pytest
    - enabling automated testing **github actions**
8. Modular code development
    -  Making reusing parts of your code easier 



# Version control & collaborative development for research software

## Goal:
> Help researchers get familiar with using Git for effectively managing source code and decentralised repository as well as succesfully manage research software, establishing efficient workflows and splitting resposabilities within a project

## Requirements:
Little knowledge on command-line interface with Unix Shell. It is required to know how to navigate, create, edit, visualise and append command output to a file via Unix Shell. Software carpentry 2 and 3 content is desired.

## Level:
Essentials (foundational skills)

## Duration:
4 half days

## Overview content and lessons:

1. Fundamental operations with git:
    - git repositories for version control
    - tracking changes in working documents
    - organizing tracked changes in a history
2. Branching and remote operations:
    - branching
    - operations with remotes
3. Collaborative software development:
    - connecting to code repositories
    - exploring Github GUI
    - management strategies
    - documenting issues
    - pull reuqests
4. Collaborative software development:
    - code reviews
    - guidelines
    - open source license
    - citation
    - releasing software
    - semantic versioning


# Good practices in Research software development

## Goal:
> Researchers learn good software practices and skills to  facilitatew open and reproducible research, focus on methods to build, modular, reusable, maintainable, sustainable, reproducible, testable, and robust software

## Requirements:
Little knowledge on command-line interface with Unix Shell. It is required to know how to navigate, create, edit, visualise and append command output to a file via Unix Shell. Software carpentry 2 and 3 content is desired.

## Level:
